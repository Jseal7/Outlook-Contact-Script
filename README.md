A GUI made with Tkinter library displays options to run Python Script that takes an Excel Sheet called Outlook_contacts and reads the information written into it to create Outlook contacts. 
It also has the option to run the reverse of that script which will take a users current Outlook contacts and paste them into a formatted Excel sheet.

Originally created this project as a way to solve a problem that was given to me during my time at DEKA Technologies as a Summer 24' Intern.
